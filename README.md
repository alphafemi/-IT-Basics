COMPUTER DESCILPLINES

Computer engineering--
*Design of hardware systems and software that make them work.
*Development of IoT (Internet of things- (alarm system, refrigerator)).

Computer Science--
 *Developing effective ways to solve computer problems and create new ways to use computers.
* Robotics, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and algorithms.

Software Engineering--
*Development and maintenance of reliable and efficient software systems.

Information Systems-
*Is the concept of integrating IT solutions to meet organizational business goals.

Information Technology--
* Focuses on technology supporting information systems in an organization.
* Responds to the practical needs of the organization.

 Computer History
1. First (1940-1956)- Scientific and military applications
 *. Computers were the size of entire rooms.
 *. Slow speed and high-power consumption.
 *. Example ENIAC and UNIVAC.

2. Second (1956-1963) - Commercial and Research Purposes
 *. Converted Vacuum to Transistor.
 *. Better than the previous generation on reliability and speed.
 *. Example IBM 7090, CDC 1604.

3. Third (1964-1971)– Business and industries
 *. Compacting multiple transistors into an integrated circuit (IC).
 *. Compact and powerful, higher speed, and less heat production.
 *. IBM 360, PDP-8.

4. Fourth(1971--present) -User-friendly and GUIs for common user
 *. Microprocessor introduction – CPU onto a single chip.
 *. Affordable for personal computers, powerful, GUI, Small in size.
 *. Intel 4004, Apple Macintosh.

5. Fifth(present--beyond) – AI (Future Generations)
 *. AI systems capable of performing complex tasks aka natural language processing, image recognition, and autonomous decision making.
 *. Quantum Computing.
