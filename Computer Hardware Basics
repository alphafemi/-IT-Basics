Computer Hardware Basics

The computer system is divided into different categories or functions
1. Input
2. Computation processing (CPU(ALU))
3. Output
4. Storage

Computer Hardware

+. Motherboard – central circuit board which all other devices connect or interact.

+. Power Supply – converts electricity into something usable for the computer.

+. GPU - A GPU (graphics processing unit) accelerates rendering of images, videos, and animations by handling many calculations in parallel.

+. Hard Drive – Long-Term Information Storage.

+. Ram – Short-Term information storage; lost after the computer is turned off.

+. ROM – located on the motherboard and contains the stored firmware and basic instructions for bootup and essential tasks. This is non-volatile.

+. CPU – electronic circuit responsible for executing computer program instruction.

+. ALU – performs operations such as addition and subtraction.

+. Control unit – coordinating machine activities.

+. Processor register – data storage cells known as registers.

CPU Processing Stages.
1. Transfer the data from the main memory into registers.
2. Informs the ALU which registers hold the data.
3. Activates the ALU.
4. Tells the ALU which register should receive the result.
